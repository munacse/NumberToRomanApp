# Number To Roman App
I have created a library that expose a class named NumbertoRomanParser, It takes a number and returns the roman numeral representation.

1 -> I, 5 -> V, 4 -> IV

Support numbers from 0 -> 10,000


In this NumbertoRomanParser class, I have written a function named NumberToRoman.

Number to Roman number convertion is a one kind of math. I have developed an algorithm to solve this problem. 

Lets we want to conver 25 to its roman number. Lets try to solve it, by our algorithm.
